3724	1	lamictal	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	bipolar disorder	Lamictal stabilized my serious mood swings. One minute I was clawing up the walls in pure mania, the next curled up in a fetal position on my bed contemplating suicdie. I am no longer at the whim of my moods and neither are those around me. I'm lucky that I started pharmaceuticals almost immediately after I was diagnosed a bipolar. Lamictal gives me amazing clarity to go about my day, honestly assess myself and form real relationships. Lamitcal lifted a fog, I guess you could call it. Now that I'm medicated I realize how cloudy my thought processes used to be. It's a wonderful feeling. Interestingly, I hardly dreamt before beginning Lamictal. I would dream (I mean dream in the sense of being able to imagine pictures and scenes while asleep, not REM) maybe once every two months. Now I dream every night. I found that the closer I take it to bedtime the more frequent and more intense my dreams.	Drowsiness, a bit of mental numbness. If you take too much, you will feel sedated. Since you have to be able to clearly and honestly assess your emotions and thoughts, determining how much medication you need is tough. I found that 400mg works perfectly for me, but that's a high dose. Less than that and I can feel the medicine wearing off prematurely (I like it to last 24hrs, from sleep to sleep). More than that and I feel numb. Some might call it drowsiness, but it's more a sluggishness of the mind for me. Before I began treating my bipolar disorder, I used to write a fair amount of fiction. It sort of flowed from me. I definitely had the artist's temperament. After Lamictal, though, that inherent creativity fizzled out. It doesn't come spilling out of me while I'm deep into a manic euphoria. I have to work at art now. It's something that requires discipline. If you are in a field which requires creativity, expect to see a change in your output.	Severe mood swings between hypomania and depression with suicide ideation before Lamictal. Began with 10mg and tritrated up to 400mg over a few months. Played around with the dosage to finally arrive at 400mg. Experimented with taking it at different times in the evening. Found that most comfortable time is before sleep.
3824	1	depakene	4	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	bipolar disorder	Initial benefits were comparable to the brand name version of this drug, Depakote.  I had been taking Depakote for several months and experienced great results.  When I went to my psychiatrist for an evaluation and re-fill, he accidently prescribed the generic version, Depakene.  When I discovered the error, I was told by this doctor that I would experience the same results as Depakote.  The positive side effects of the Depakene: balanced mood, improved concentration, improved logical cognition, mental clarity, lessened anxiety and irritability, improved sleep, increase in pleasure about activities	Depakene has a very thin coating, which caused severe heart burn and stomach upset.  The discomfort was so unpleasant that it made me not want to take my meds, so I was not taking them consistently as prescribed.  This caused my mood to fluctuate again.  Even after I switched to the Depakote, my stomach was still uncomfortable for several weeks afterwards.  My appetite decreased and food was very unappetizing.  Certain foods that I normally enjoy, such as chicken or fish, made me feel extremely queasy when I ate them.  I did not like the physical side effect of the drug, and decided to quit my psychiatric drugs altogether - because I was no longer stable anymore!	Depakote was prescribed to me by a Kaiser psychiatrist in Pleasant Hill, CA in 2006.  The medication was given to help treat the diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder, Type II.  My disease was misdiagnosed for several years as depression, since I was never seen by a professional during hypomanic episodes, and when I did see a professional, I did not think that my manic symptoms were signs of a serious psychiatric problem.  Anti-depressant drugs were prescribed: Prozac in 2001, which had minimal effect and I stopped taking them a few months later. Wellbutrin was prescribed again for "chronic depression" in the spring of 2006, but this medication slowly spun me into an intense manic period.  After the manic episode, I fell very hard into a severe, suicidal depressive state.  I was voluntarily admitted to a psychiatric ward in June 2006 to keep me safe and to properly diagnose my condition.  The symptoms I was experiencing before being prescribed the Depakote/Depakene: rapidly cycling mood swings between intense activation and irritablity/excitement and crashing lows and depression, suicidal thoughts, poor logic and decision making, racing thoughts, anxiety, poor concentration, and poor sleep.
1598	1	xanax	5	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety	The xanax would act as a downer. It would calm me temporaily but could throw me into depression depending on the situation. If the situation was mildly tramatic the xanax would calm me but then follow by depression. The following day I would have residual sedation. The main complain was the addiction. It was not exactly like a craving but if you did not take it your body would feel like something was missing. It did not hurt but until I took it again I felt not quite content and as soon as I would take the pill my body would feel like it would give a sigh of relief. I think it is as much addiction to the mind as to the body.	As I explained above. Addiction and drowsiness. Your mind and body felt like you were missing something. Until you took the pill you would be anxious but for no reason but as soon as you took the pill your mind would be relived. You would no longer dwell on the anxiety.	Once a day preferably at bedtime but if a situation arose I would have to take another sooner and still one at bedtime in order to sleep.
545	1	propranolol	5	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	rapid heart rate	I have suffered of rapid heart rate for sometime because of my thyroid problem. I was given this medicine to get my heart rate controlled. First few weeks the medicine did not seem to work for me but my doctor increased the dosage to 20mg twice a day, then that was the time I started to feel my heart rate slow down. The medicine is definitely effective but I guess the effect of it depends on the individual as it requres a certain dosage for it to work effectively.	I started feeling dizzy whenever I get up from sitting position to standing. I have informed my doctor about this and I was informed that this is a possible side effect of the drug.	Details as above.
3690	1	effexor-xr	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	severe depression	i was severly depressed for weeks and would just cry all the time. i had tried several other anidepressants and none of them worked. one day my doctor said lets try a new drug called effexor xr. i was started on 75 mg for about 2 months and was still depressed so then i was increased to 150 mg and have been on it since. i an so much happier and my family is also. this medicine has been my life saver and recommend anyone depressed to take this one	i very vivid dreams but i can live with this side effect to be happy	i found that the treatment plan has made life worth living
2451	1	symbyax	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	bipolar disorder	The benefits were great. I really liked Symbyax because it didn't give me side effects like the other medication I used to take did. I would wake up in the day feeling refreshed. As I was taking Seroquil for my Schitzophrenia, I would always wake up feeling exhausted and tired;still, even though I would take the medicine during the nights! I used to be stressed and aggravated all the time before Symbyax and Seroquil. Now that I'm on Symbyax, I'm emotionally numb and the voices in my head vanished. So I had a good nights sleep and didn't wake up as tired as Seroquil used to make me. 	I didn't really have many side effects besides the medicine making me want to go to sleep. But I'm not complaining, since it does help the voices and the shadows go away for a while. Besides that, my psychiatrist wanted me to take advantage of the other side effect, and that side effect is that Symbyax might make you gain a little weight. So I wouldn't suggest it to people who want to lose weight. I still didn't seen any change in the weight gain and it was about a month when I started taking the lowest dose of Symbyax. Now that that month is over, I just started taking a higher dosage and I have noticed an increase in my appetite. I recommend this drug for the depressed ones who are a little underweight and the Schitzophrenics.	As I was being diagnosed for my Bipolar disorder, I would say the medication did more for me than my therapist. The drug, Symbyax, made me more calm than I have ever been. It took about a week for the medicine to kick in and when it did, it really did work its magic even though Seroquil was pretty good at knocking me out to sleep, it didn't help me with my anxiety and depression like Symbyax has.
3161	1	prednisone	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	crohns	reduced bowel inflammation over a long period of time. when flare ups were severe, patient had to increase dose to 40mg daily and the dosage was tappered back to original dosage of 10mg.	there was a loss in bone density. however, after introducing actonel the patient's bone density did improve. also, the patient did report problems with concentration and did report mood swings.	the treatment was used because the condition was not improving with the use of other medications. therefore, after introducing prednisone the patient's condition improved significantly. when the patient stopped taking the medications it resulted in the resurgence of a flare up.
189	1	adderall	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	adult add	Adderall greatly improved my focus and concentration.  Before my diagnosis of adult ADD, I had a very difficult time focusing and staying on task.  I also experienced "hyper-focusing", which prevented me from getting things done at work in a timely manner.  It has also helped improved my memory.	I didn't notice any side effects from Adderall.  However, it is metabolized very quickly and only stays effective for about 3 to 4 hours.  Forgetting to take the second dose around 1:00pm makes for a confusing afternoon, until I remember to take it.	My prescriber and I went through about 3 different medications before Adderall, and those did have unpleasant side effects such as sweaty palms (all the time), dizziness, and heart palpitations.  Once I found that Adderall didn't cause side effects for me, we gradually increased the dosage from 5 mg to 10mg and then back down to 7.5 mg which works best for me.
1145	1	ponstel	7	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	migraine	Although it did not completely rid me of my migraine it helped to dull the pain. I was actually able to go to work with a migraine instead to taking a day off to just lie still.	no side effects.	At the first symptoms of a migraine I wojld pop a copule of tablets. For severe migraines I would repeat the dosage about 8 hours later. However, over time I found the medication to be less effective and ultimately stopped taking it. It seems as though my body became immune to it's effectiveness.
3108	1	ortho-tri-cyclen	4	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	birth control/control of menstrual cycle	The Ortho Tri-Cyclen provided effective birth control, and it also did cause my mentstrual cylcle to be more regular. My periods were less heavy, and I did not have such severe menstrual cramping each month while I was taking the pills. There are no other benefits to taking the pill that I am aware of.	I experienced migraine headaches several times per week where I could not do anything other than lay down with the lights off while on this medication. At first, I had no idea what was causing them, but my doctor informed me that my symptoms could be indicative of a more severe side effect, and she therefore advised me to stop taking them. They also caused some bloating and moodiness.	The Ortho Tri-Cyclen birth control pills are a low dosage progesterone treatment that is intended to prevent pregnancy. I was required to take one pill every day. My understanding is that I experienced a relatively rare side effect with the migraines. I have not heard any similar complaints from friends who were taking the same pill, other than complaints about weight gain, bloating and mild acne.
3816	1	nolvadex	7	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	breast cancer	The benefits of tamoxifen have been to be cancer free 2 years after my diagnosis. Hopefully this "clean bill of health" will continue as I begin year 3 of tamoxifen in my 5 year plan. The benefits of effexor help balance the mood swings caused by a lowered amount of estrogen in my body. Tamoxifen does its job by keeping the estrogen blocked in my body so any abnormal cells can't feed on the estrogen. My cancer was highly estrogen-positive. Lowered estrogen causes depression and mood swings. Effexor helps to alleviate these symptoms along with my exercise regime and healthy eating habits.	Side effects were more severe at the onset of taking tamoxifen. I had hot flashes that were quite severe. They often came without warning especially at mealtime. I also had some body aches and pains. Vaginal dryness was also severe. My period became erratic. After 2 years most side effects have decreased - hot flashes are gone as well as the aches. My period has been non-existant for 4 months. However, I feel irritable and edgy about the regularly scheduled time for a few days. The effexor helps. Dryness is still a problem but not as severe. Vaginal odor continues to be a concern.	I was put on Tamoxifen for 5 years following my 9/05 breast cancer diagnosis. I started Tamoxifen 12/05. I started Zoloft 2 months later when I began having mood swings. Zoloft helped for a year then I felt my symptoms returning. I began Effexor at 75 mg and have been fine. My oncologist felt I am young and strong (age 46, exercise 4 times weekly, runner, martial artist) and that I should try to lower or end my Effexor. However, I didn't agree. I needed help with the mood swings and irritability. I can't lose my temper at work. I work with developmentally disabled adults. Losing my temper could be my job. I did try a natural regime of vitamins (B-12 and E) for several months but I felt no relief. Friends even told me about my mood. I went from depressed to angry in a flash. The 75 mg of Effexor is wonderful. My estrogen is blocked by the Tamoxifen and the effexor helps keep me at an even keel.
398	1	relpax	5	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	migraine headaches	The medication took almost thirty minutes to kick in.  Once the medication started to take affect, I began to develop a tingling sensation in my left hand and later my right hand.  I also noticed my hands were very shaky after the medication was in my system for at least an hour.	The medication took almost thirty minutes to kick in.  Once the medication started to take affect, I began to develop a tingling sensation in my left hand and later my right hand.  I also noticed my hands were very shaky after the medication was in my system for at least an hour.	Once a migraine is formulating, one pill is to be taken.

I also noticed my hands were very shaky after the medication was in my system for at least an hour.
33	1	alprazolam	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety	About 14 years ago I started hyperventilating for no apparent reason.  I would wake up in the morning and within an hour I felt like I had to struggle to breath.  This would continue all day, every day.  After 5 years, I was prescribed alprazolam (the generic Xanax).  It worked almost immediately.  I still have some days that are worse than others, but it has been a lifesaver for me.  I take one when I get up and then 2 or 3 times again during the day as needed.  It stops the hyperventilating totally for the most part.	The only side effect is a mild drowsiness.  I take a very small dose.  The highest I take at one time is .5 mg.	I take one .25 mg pill within 1 hour of waking up.  I usually take the second one around noon and another before going to bed.  If my condition is worse for whatever reason, then I might take another one during the day, or one .5 mg in the evening.  Sometimes if I'm busy and I miss taking a dose, and I feel myself beginning to hyperventilate, I'll then take one.  It works fast.
533	1	trazodone	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia/poor sleep quality	Could fairly quickly fall asleep, and usually stay alseep, with little "sleep hangover" problem that most other medications result in. I could function in the morning. My general health started improving (fewer flues and colds, headaches, stress and depression, and I had much, much less pain as I started getting regular sleep.	Some constipation, maybe dry mouth and eyes (not sure if there is a direct cause and effect, but definitely an overlap in timing). About three months ago I started waking up during the night (anywhere from 12:30 am to 3 am) without being able to go back to sleep. Have tried numerous other medications and they all had much, much worse side effects that trazodone.	I'm not sure what you mean by this, I take trazodone nightly, and have taken it for at least two years. My worst experience from other sleep medications came from ambien (well before my doctor had even heard of the side effects I was having, nor were they listed on the medication or mentioned in the news). I also take cymbalta in conjunction with trazadone, which also supposedly helps you sleep, but the cymbalta alone is not effective for sleep at all for me.
2692	1	indocin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	rheumatoid arthritis	Indomethacin immediate reduced the very inflamed and painful swelling in first joint of my left forefinger, my first - and thanks to prompt treatment with this drug - my only attack of rhumatoid arthritis.  I didn't recognise this swelling as arthritis because it was my first attack, and I neglected to seek medical advice until the joint was extremely inflamed and swollen.  Since this attack, I've used the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ibuprofen as needed to prevent further attacks.	I experienced no adverse side effects when using Indomethacin with food as directed, and was very pleased with the almost immediate reduction in pain and swelling.	My doctor prescribed one 25mg capsule 3 times a day with food, for one month, which I followed; this treatment was completely successful for me. Since this treatment, I've used the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ibuprofen as needed to prevent further attacks.
